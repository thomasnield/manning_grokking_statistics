# Welcome! 

Thank you for your interest in reading my book _Grokking Statistics_. This is a topic I have wanted to write about for a long time, because statistics is so often misunderstood and yet increasingly relevant. So much data is being collected and modernn techniques to get automated insights, like machine learning and artificial intelligence, amplify both the opportunities and challenges of statistics. Therefore, having a strong foundation in this topic is more important than ever! 

The book is a mix of practical theory, generous illustrations, fun cartoons, and demonstrative Python code. The Python code seeks to demonstrate how techniques work, rather than lean heavily on libraries to do everything for you. 

The current chapters are as follows: 

| Chapter | Title |
|---------|-------|
| 1 | Why You Should Care About Statistics |
| 2 | Meet Your Data! |
| 3 | So You’re Telling Me There’s a Chance! |
| 4 | The Grand Exhibit of Normality |
| 5 | Sample Size Superpowers |
| 6 | Coincidence? I Think NOT! |
| 7 | How Different Are Differences? |
| 8 | Number Go Up! (Or Down) |
| 9 | Yes, No, or Maybe So? |
| 10 | Crimes Against Data |
| 11 | The Statistics Survival Guide
