# Welcome! 

Thank you for your interest in reading _Grokking Statistics_! This is a topic I wanted to write about for a long time, because statistics is often misunderstood and yet increasingly relevant. So much data is being collected. Modern techniques to get automated insights, like machine learning and large language models, amplify both the opportunities and challenges of statistics. Therefore, having a strong foundation in this topic is more important than ever! 

To get the most benefit from this book, having some exposure and comfort with Python will help, including basic usage of NumPy, pandas, and matplotlib. You do not have to be an expert in Python or these libraries, but it helps to not be intimidated by a *little* code. Python will help bring concepts and calculations to life, but there will also be a practical mix of theory, generous illustrations, and fun cartoons to go along with demonstrative Python code. The Python code seeks to demonstrate how techniques work, rather than lean heavily on libraries to do everything for you. There is a notebook in each chapter folder, titled `ch4.ipynb`, `ch5.ipynb`, etc., for all the Python code used in the book. Please excuse the mess of SVG and PNG files in each chapter folder. I will be reorganizing them later as I clean up the assets for publishing. 

There are already books on statistics out there, with more increasingly utilizing Python. But what I hope to make different with this book is an approach fits into the "Grokking" spirit, focusing on intuition, explanation, and concepts in a minimalist but helpful way, and how classical approaches apply to modern statistics including machine learning. We will also spend the last two chapters covering how broken incentive structures and p-hacking drive outcomes unproductively, and what you can do about it in your own career. 

The current chapters are as follows: 

| Chapter | Title |
|---------|-------|
| 1 | Why You Should Care About Statistics |
| 2 | Meet Your Data! |
| 3 | So You’re Telling Me There’s a Chance! |
| 4 | The Grand Exhibit of Normality |
| 5 | Sample Size Superpowers |
| 6 | Coincidence? I Think NOT! |
| 7 | How Different Are Differences? |
| 8 | Number Go Up! (Or Down) |
| 9 | Yes, No, or Maybe So? |
| 10 | Crimes Against Data |
| 11 | The Statistics Survival Guide
